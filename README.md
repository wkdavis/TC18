# Using R and Tableau at Worthington Industries | Price optimization for high-mix, low-volume environments
Worthington Industries’ steel products are highly customized to end-user specifications. This high-mix, low-volume business makes price optimization using traditional methods difficult. Determining which products/markets to include or exclude from a given comparative analysis is often subjective and can lead to inconsistent recommendations. In our case, machine learning methods resulted in over-fitting due to insufficient training data. Tableau with R allows our analysts to test different market conditions using the power of predictive analytics (logistic regression) in a user-friendly environment. This tool represents the latest evolution in Worthington’s growing adoption of Tableau Server, deploying increasingly sophisticated features to our 50+ users.
